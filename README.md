# C-3 Task

# AI-ML-CORNER TASK

Before starting with the tasks I read the Grokkings Deep Learning book so that I get a breif knowledge about how a neural network works.
After that I also made a model on Dogs vs Cat classification based on cnn.
After all this I started with the task.

- Easy: 
  
   
   - Task_1: This was a very easy task as I had to make a simple python program to guess the number in a specific number of turns. And there are some rules to follow while solving this task.

   - Task_2: In this task I had to find the pattern in the array given.

   - Task_3: In this task I had to write a simple python program to find the colors of the flag.

- Medium:
   
   In this task I had to make a model on Iris Model where I had used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the relationship between petal_length and petal width and sepal length and sepal_width. Also to find the prediction I used svm and logistic regression.

- Hard:

    In this task I was having a lot of difficulty. The crux of the question is that first the train dataset has to divided into (train_x,train_y) and (test_x,test_y) and this has to be used to train a model. After this the actual test dataset has to be used to find the prediction. I used cnn model to find the prediction.
