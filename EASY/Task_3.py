While hunting one of his friends reveals that he is Color Blind and thus is unable to find the colors of the flag he had to find. 
Help Shri Ram classify these colours.

# ** Task details:
'''

Create a Python Script that can classify colours: Red, Blue and Green.
You can approach this task by using a set of colour ranges for each category and
then using simple if-else statements to determine the colour category based on the RGB values of the input colour.
